### Introduce

[zebra-axios-adapter](https://axios.zebraui.com/) is an [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) adapter for UniApp, supporting mini-programs, H5 and App platforms.

Axios is a promise-based network request library that works in node.js and browsers. Due to the different request mechanisms of mini-programs, Axios cannot be used directly in mini-programs. This adapter is designed to solve this problem.
